## BerkShares: Great Barrington, Massachusetts

The BerkShares project is an alternative currency project geared towards encouraging local spending and community pride. The availability of a local currency grants the citizens of Great Barrington to get a discount on locally purchased goods. This opportunity is available to everyone choosing to visit the small town. To participate, citizens go to one of the local banks sponsoring the program. The arrangement allows them to exchange ninety five dollars for one hundred BerkShares, essentially offering them a 5% discount if they choose to participate. Businesses also see significant benefit from the program. The alternative currency increases local patronage, allowing for the microeconomy to expand. The success of the program has seen the local currency being accepted by more than four hundred businesses in the Great Barrington community. 

To date, there are approximately 2.5 million locally printed BerkShares in circulation. The project has been the topic of numerous articles due to its success. The great idea has garnered the attention of national and international publications such as Business Week, The London Times, Reuters, NPR, ABC World News, The New York Times, Time Magazine, BBC News. They praised the currency for many things, including its vibrant colors and depiction of local history. 

The BerkShares program is the brainchild of Susan Witt and Robert Swann in collaboration with the E.F. Schumacher Society. The project began as a local currency seasonal experiment, and was so successful that the banks supporting it requested that it be done year-round. Witt and Swann agreed, and the BerkShares began being issued in 2006. 

BerkShares: Great Barrington, Massachusetts The BerkShares program has been a case study on how a local currency program can improve not only economy, but community pride.
